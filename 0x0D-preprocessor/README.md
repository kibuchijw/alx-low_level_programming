## Learning Objectives

### General

* What are macros and how to use them
* What are the most common predefined macros
* How to include guard your header files

| Task | File |
| ---- | ---- |
| 0. Object-like Macro | [0-object_like_macro.h](./0-object_like_macro.h) |
| 1. Pi | [1-pi.h](./1-pi.h) |
| 2. File name | [2-main.c](./2-main.c) |
| 3. Function-like macro | [3-function_like_macro.h](./3-function_like_macro.h) |
| 4. SUM | [4-sum.h](./4-sum.h) |

## Tasks
### 0. Object-like Macro
* A header file that defines a macro named `SIZE` as an abbreviation for the token `1024`
### 1. Pi
* A header file that defines a macro named `PI` as an abbreviation for the token `3.14159265359`.
### 2. File name
* A program that prints the name of the file it was compiled from. followed by a new line.
	* Standard libray allowed
### 3. Function-like macro
* A function-like macro `ABS(X)` that computes the absolute value of a number `x`.
### 4. SUM
* A function-like macro `SUM(x, y)` that computes the sum of the numbers `x` and `y`.
