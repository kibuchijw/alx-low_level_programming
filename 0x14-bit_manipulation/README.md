The exercises herein are meant to practice C - Bit manipulation
1. 0-binary_to_uint.c - Function that converts a binary number to an unsigned int
2. 1-print_binary.c - Function that prints binary representation of a number
3. 2-get_bit.c - Function that returns value of a bit at a given index
4. 3-set_bit.c - Function that sets value of a bit to 1 at given index
5. 4-clear_bit.c - Function that sets value of a bit to 0 at given index
6. 5-flip_bits.c - Function returning number of bits needed to flip to get from one bit to                   the other
7. 100-get_endianness.c - Function that checks the endianness
